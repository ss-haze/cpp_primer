*Exercise 1.1

> Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from page 2.
* [GCC and file extensions](http://http://labor-liber.org/en/gnu-linux/development/index.php?diapo=extensions)

*Exercise 1.2 
> Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.

Changing the return to -1 makes the program return a value of 'False'
