### Exercise 11.1
> Describe the differences between a map and a vector
```
Elements in a vector are stored and accessed sequentially by their position in the vector.
The position is an integer value.

Elements in a map are stored and retrieved by a key. The key does not have to be an integer.
```

### Exercise 11.2
> Give an exampleof when each of list, vector, deque, map and set might be most useful.
```
set: useful for determining whether a value is present.
map: useful for situations that require a data pair, e.g. account number and balance
vector: useful for random-access, last insert/delete use
list: useful for middle insert/delete containers
deque: useful for when we need random-access, first/last insert/delete e.g. modelling a queue
```
