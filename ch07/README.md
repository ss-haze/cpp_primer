### [Exercise 7.8] 
> Why does read define its Sales_data parameter as a plain reference and print define its parameter as a reference to const?
```
Read's parameter is a ref, and this parameter is then modified and returned by the function.

Print takes a const ref Sales_data object, which it prints out and does not change. This function can print both normal and const Sales_data objects.
```
